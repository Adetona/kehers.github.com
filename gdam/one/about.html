            <h5 class="ttl-alt">Company History</h5>
            <p>EDAM Nigeria evolved from the Asset Management unit of Express Discount Ltd (EDL) following the significant growth in the asset portfolio of the company and the outstanding performance of its asset management business. To maximize investment opportunities and returns from this line of business, EDAM was birthed and incorporated in May 2005 as a private limited liability company and licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to engage in Asset Management Services and act as an Investment House.</p>

            <h5 class="ttl-alt">Company Ownership</h5>
            <p>EDAM Nigeria was until December 10, 2014, a wholly owned subsidiary of Express Discount Limited (EDL) now in liquidation, one of the five Discount Houses registered to carry out, transact and trade in government issued securities in Nigeria. Express Discount Limited (EDL) was recently declared insolvent by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and a Liquidator, Mr. Babatunde Ajayi of Babington Ashaye & Co. was appointed by CBN.</p>

            <p>Consequently, Express Discount Asset Management Limited (EDAM Nigeria) being a wholly owned subsidiary of EDL, became one of the assets to be disposed by the Liquidator. The Liquidator, with the consent of CBN, granted the current Management of EDAM (The MBO Team) a dispensation to continue to run the Company as a going concern.</p>

            <p>Subsequently, the MBO Team, made a bid to the Liquidator to buy The Company, and received an Offer from the Liquidator to acquire 100% of the equity capital of The Company which was accepted.</p>

        <div class="six columns">
            <h5 class="ttl-alt">New Core Investor</h5>
            <p>Growth & Development Limited (GDL) after completion of a due diligence on EDAM Nigeria and the MBO Team financed the Bid to become the new core investor in the company. Consequent to the payment of due consideration and agreement of terms by the MBO Team, GDL and CBN appointed Liquidator in person of Mr. Babatunde Ajayi of Babington Ashaye & Co., the Company has been effectively bought out from CBN through the Liquidator.</p>

            <p>A Sale and Purchase Agreement has been executed with the CBN appointed Liquidator to further evidence the buy over of EDAM Nigeria by GDL. GDL is currently concluding documentation and has brought in additional N330, 000,000 (Three Hundred and Thirty Million Naira only) to meet up with SEC minimum capital requirements. This has increased paid-up capital from N170m to N500m while Shareholders Funds has increased to N452, 000,000.00.</p>

            <h5 class="ttl-alt">Company Location</h5>
            <p>Our office is located on the fifth floor, Marine View Plaza, 60, Marina, Lagos.</p>

      <p>I put the bus to a halt and switched off the engine. The doors slip open and we got down. The environment was neat; some 5 bungalows standing in different corners of the compound. I spotted few adults. 2 were in security uniform, some 2 were fixing a broken part of the fence beside the gate and some other 3 or 4 busy around a smaller bungalow with smoke sneaking out. Then there were kids. Lots of them. They should rage between the ages of like 3 and 17. They were not too well dressed. Some were bare footed. But in an interesting way, they were happy.<p /> Some 20 minutes away, we were settled in white plastic chairs in the center of a room with the kids settled in class room desks to our both sides. The supervisor gave a brief welcome note and introduced the 'Destiny child' orphanage. He was dressed in a simple polo shirt, jeans and light slippers. He should be in his mid twenties. He explained to us the orphanage was established by the first lady of the state in 2009 and they currently have around a hundred kids in the house, the others in different schools. He mentioned they try to provide the possible support and teachings the kids could have received from their parents - moral, guidance, counseling, godliness, care and all. About 70% of the kids get to get some form of formal education, while the remaining 30% who can't get some form of skilled training.<p /> We praised and worshiped with them, talked with them, played with them, gave them gifts and took pictures with them. I got the lessons too. One is to appreciate the simple little things of life. These kids may never even know what its like to have real parents. They have their dreams too. When we asked them, we got interesting answers. Footballers, actors, actresses, engineers, doctors, pastor (we laughed at that) and others. But how easy will it be without the parental push to achieving this? How well do we that are fostered with this care appreciate it? How well do we appreciate the good cloths we have on, the nice shoes and the warmth of our home? And the family we are blessed with? The other is the definition of true happiness. In the end, it is not about what you have or don't. The kids just made it seem like a way of life. You should see the way they chorused the praises and clapped. Thunderous. And the way they played, joked and laughed was just so true.<p /> It's kinda weird, but I simply had fun. There are always the less privileged around us. We should try and reach out to them when we can and in simple ways we can.</p>

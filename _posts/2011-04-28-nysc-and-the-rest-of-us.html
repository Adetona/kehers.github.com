The wrong things we place values on in this country has not failed to <br />amaze me. Really, I wonder why whoever came up with NYSC thought I owe <br />Nigeria a one year compulsory service. Well, compulsory not like do or <br />die; but compulsory like there are some appointments and higher <br />education you can't take. You get. <p /> Ok fine, the government gave me free education and provided for all my <br />study course and in exchange require a compulsory one year service, <br />shouldn't I be treated fair at all? <p /> By the way, this is not even an argument of if NYSC should be scrapped <br />on not. If the government thinks I owe her a one year compulsory <br />service year, shouldn't my welfare be top priority? Oh, you havent <br />seen my bathing water at camp right? The government should understand <br />that not all of us finish school, have nothing to do and would rather <br />patiently wait for service to be able to earn a meagre N10,000/month. <br />(Yeah, I heard N18,000+ has been approved, but I'm yet to see that <br />effect in my account). I know the service is a good exchange program <br />and all, but my number one argument is it should be optional. I mean <br />truly optional - the one with no 'side effects'. <p /> Two, corps security and welfare should be top priority. Here is one <br />month into service and a lot of my friends are still prowling the <br />streets of Cross River looking for places of primary assignment. And <br />the one I got? Nice one, good place. Only that no accommodation <br />provided (in a City I don't know anyone in) and I won't be paid for <br />the first 3-4 months. I can only always be grateful to religious <br />bodies like NCCF, RCCF and co for providing accomodation and feeding <br />for corp members for as long as they want to stay. (There are few <br />catch and rules attached though). And security? That is worth a whole <br />blog rant on its own. I still don't understand why the government <br />still post corpers to crisis prone areas like Jos, Kaduna, Kano and co <br />every year even in the midst of such crisis despite the many lives <br />lost year in, year out. I must say I really commend the Lagos, Ondo <br />and Ogun government for withdrawing their serving citizens from this <br />areas but question now is what is the FG's plan on security for the <br />next batch? <p /> On a lighter note, you can check out my camp journal @ <br /><a href="http://backshout.tumblr.com/">http://backshout.tumblr.com/</a>

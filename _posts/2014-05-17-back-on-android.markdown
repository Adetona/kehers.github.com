title: Back on Android

I got an iPhone 4s some time late last year. I wanted the experience. Then<br />
development purpose - if I eventually get to it. For a couple of months,<br />
the phone was my secondary device; I used it occasionally for the apps.<br />
Then, for some two months now, I have had it as my only device. It has been<br />
a great experience. But now I have had to switch back to Android.<br />
<br />
This is not one of the Android is better than iPhone posts. I do have my<br />
preferred platforms, technologies and tools but I am not a fanboy. The post<br />
is an objective view of why I had to switch back.<br />
<br />
The iPhone is a solid device. You only have to hold it to be convinced.<br />
Great camera! (My new Moto G camera is poor by the way). And the iPhone<br />
just works. The app experience is superb. You hardly ever encounter the<br />
popular ARN (Application Not Responding) you get on Android. For a regular<br />
user (which unfortunately I am not), it is the perfect phone. It gives you<br />
just what you want. Distracting options are removed wherever possible. For<br />
example, the camera doesn&#039;t have a **settings** button. So things like<br />
adjusting white balance or setting photo resolution are out of it, leaving<br />
you fewer distractions to fiddle with. But even this strong point of<br />
simplicity links to the other factors that makes the iPhone too limiting<br />
for me.<br />
<br />
##Android - everything as an app<br />
<br />
On Android, everything is an app. Your camera, SMS, keyboard, dialer, even<br />
power button. This means you can easily change core things on the phone.<br />
That gives you a different level of flexibility - like  using the awesome<br />
[Swype](http://swype.com) or [Swiftkey](http://www.swiftkey.net/) keyboard<br />
for example.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you may have more than one of these apps performing the same<br />
function. That is where **default apps** come in. If besides my Android&#039;s<br />
native web browser, I have Chrome, Firefox and Opera mini, I can set<br />
 Firefox as my default web browser so that every time I click a link within<br />
an app, it opens with Firefox. It is just the same way you can set your<br />
default web browser or media player on PC (at least Windows). On the iPhone<br />
I don&#039;t have that. Every link I open (well, except in Gmail) opens in<br />
Safari. I can&#039;t set another browser as my default.<br />
<br />
In general, Android offers a more flexible and open development platform to<br />
allow creative play with core device features and a whole different level<br />
of customization. Themes, launchers, live wallpapers and amazing taskers<br />
are a result of this. [IFTTT for Android](<br />
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.ifttt), for<br />
example, can consequently access things like phone calls, Wifi and SMS for<br />
triggers; ringtone, volume and wallpaper for actions.<br />
<br />
##Intents<br />
<br />
Android allows apps share data via intents. From my gallery for example, I<br />
can share a picture to any other image related app (remember, everything on<br />
Android is an app) - IM apps (WhatsApp, Hangouts), social networking apps<br />
(Twitter, Facebook), email clients, communication apps (Bluetooth, NFC),<br />
etc. It works that way across every app. The Twitter app, as another<br />
example, can share a tweet to email, SMS, Tumblr, etc.<br />
<br />
This makes app use and sharing very easy. Once done writing this on<br />
[Simplenote](http://simplenote.com) on my Android, I can easily send to the<br />
Gmail app in a click and post to this blog (via [Tinypress](<br />
http://tinypress.co)). This would be a long one on the iPhone.<br />
<br />
##Sharing, Sync, iTunes<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like that I can&#039;t **easily** share things from my phone with<br />
others. &quot;Easily&quot; here means I want to share with someone beside me and not<br />
through the internet - not using Dropbox or BBM or Whatsapp or whatever.<br />
Simple bluetooth. To non-iOS devices. And it is pretty much the same with<br />
receiving as well.<br />
<br />
I don&#039;t like that I can&#039;t easily &quot;install&quot; an app on my iPhone directly<br />
from the iTunes website. I would have imagined a login in, download button<br />
on an app page and a push of the app to my device. I shouldn&#039;t have to<br />
install iTunes for this. Same with transferring music or videos. I<br />
literally messed up and overwrote the stuffs on my phone the second time I<br />
used the iTunes to sync music and videos to the device.<br />
<br />
Android&#039;s visible and accessibile file system makes it easy to manage files<br />
and content in a familiar way. If I want to copy to or from the device, I<br />
just plug in to my computer and know where to look. Strike that. In truth,<br />
to copy to, I just need to dump my media files in any folder on the device.<br />
It shouldn&#039;t be any complex than that.<br />
<br />
Those are the core limitations for me. There are many other tiny details<br />
here and there. Like the non-standard cord/port of the iPhone, a better<br />
notification system on Android, Android&#039;s Back button, missing photo<br />
details (time/date) on the iPhone, among others. These things seem<br />
irrelevant to many average users. I have heard iPhone users reply me &quot;why<br />
not email it&quot;, &quot;send it via BBM&quot; when I complained about sharing photos via<br />
bluetooth. Just yesterday, I mentioned the friction in transfering songs<br />
from my laptop to the iPhone to a friend and he went, &quot;Do people still do<br />
that? Why not just use Spotify?&quot;. To someone like me however, device<br />
flexibility is of great importance.<br />
<br />
My new droid is a Moto G. Lovely, cheap phone. It runs on Android&#039;s latest<br />
OS (Kitkat - 4.4.2) which besides the improved experience (that&#039;s a whole<br />
different discussion) answers most of Android&#039;s cons. Performance for<br />
example. This has greatly improved. Everything runs smoothly and I am yet<br />
to see the famours ANR. UI/UX is another. It is interesting to see that<br />
most apps now follow the [standard design pattern](<br />
https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/index.html), offering a<br />
consistent and good design and experience.<br />
<br />
I should get back at discovering new interesting apps already. Or probably<br />
try build something little when I have the free time.

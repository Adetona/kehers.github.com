I really love [good code indentation](http://obem.be/2012/09/29/code-indention-it-is-this-simple.html). And writing a good code starts from a good indentation. While this is a conscious effort, your editor can make it very easy. And that is where [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) comes in. EditorConfig allows you define style rules an editor should adhere to. This makes it easy to have a consistent style even across editors.

In its simplest form, you create an "**.editorconfig**" file that will contain the rules in your source directory. (This means you can have different rules for different projects/directory). Here is the EditorConfig file for a [sample project](https://github.com/kehers/fave):

{% highlight markdown %}
root = true

[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
{% endhighlight %}

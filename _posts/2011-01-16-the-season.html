This is the seson <p /> My aunt's lips crack <br />My skin shrinks <br />Mum goes late to work <br />The flowers need more water <p /> Lovers have more sex <br />Church roll dwindles <br />Cough and catargh everwhere <br />Mornings are just kinda hard <p /> Im scared to take a shower <br />When I do, I make it hot <br />It's hard to pull an all-night <br />When I do it's cold <p /> Yeah it's that season <br />Don't tell me you don't feel it too.

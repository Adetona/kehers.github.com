One challenge I have with Jekyll on [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/) is the fact that I can't blog wherever and whenever I want to. Because the blog *practically* resides on my PC, I have to be on my PC to post or make any update.

It shouldn't be so. I should be able to blog where and when it gets me. So I created [tinypress.co](tinypress.co), a simple web app to let you post to your Github pages from web.

It's as simple as it can be at the moment. You sign in with your Github account and create your post. Nothing more. Once I have more time, I may add more features like a proper [markdown] editor, editing and deleting posts. For now enjoy it as is. For comments, suggestions, bugs or anything, buzz me via [@kehers](http://twitter.com/kehers).

And by the way, this post was published from [tinypress](http://tinypress.co).

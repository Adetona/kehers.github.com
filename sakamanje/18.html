<li><p><b>Job hunting</b> - When you first start looking for a job, it can feel slightly scary. But when you know where to look and what employers are looking for then you'll find things a bit easier. Teaming up with Sakamanje means that we can give you loads of advice to help support you as you look for jobs, create the perfect CV, and prepare for interviews.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Career Mapping</b> - We help you to map your career by illustrating it. From the map, detailed information will be a result and this information will facilitate you with  choices, based on individual talent and market needs. Like a GPS in your car, Career Mapping can display alternative routes to build mastery in the core professions. Mastery is being the “best you can be” and those who achieve mastery of their professions or trades are leaders, mentors and innovators. The knowledge, skills and ability that mastery requires is enduring and guides both simple day-to-day decisions as well as complex challenges. Following this exercise, Sakamanje guarantees that you will know exactly what you want to achieve and how to go about doing so.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Work Experience/Internship Application Assistance</b> - Final year students with work experience are three times more likely to get a graduate job offer. It’s now estimated that leading employers will fill one third of their graduate positions with those they have already employed through internships, vacation work or industrial placements. There are two main ways to find work experience: applying for advertised placements, or seeking out hidden opportunities by networking and applying speculatively. The consultants will assist you in securing a placement that will aid you in developing your skills for the future.</p></li>
<li><p><b>CV Building</b> - A skillfully crafted CV is essential to your success. You have as little as 10 seconds to make a powerful first impression because busy hiring professionals must quickly screen out hundreds (sometimes thousands) of CVs. Additionally, many use Applicant Tracking Systems built on complex resume parsing technology that helps narrow the field to just a handful of candidates. The few that survive this initial screening will then be subjected to a more careful scrutiny. A professionally written resume can dramatically increase your response rate — and substantially shorten your job-search time. Getting a job is 70% presentation and 30% actual skills and abilities. In fact, the candidate who gets the job is not always the most qualified; rather, the candidate with the best presentation will get hired. Sakamanje knows what employers want, and in the hands of our professionals, your CV becomes a powerful marketing tool that skillfully conveys the nuances and details necessary to reaching your goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Need a CV? Work with Sakamanje to create one. Through an initial 30–45 minute phone consultation and ongoing email collaboration, your writer will work with you to  craft a document that impresses recruiters and hiring managers.</p></li>
<li><p>Already have a CV? Work with Sakamanje to update your existing document and help you stand out. You’ll enjoy unlimited email interaction and receive up to two resume revisions after receiving your first draft.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Interview Preparation</b> - An interview is your chance to sell your skills, experience, education, and passion to an employer.  Successful interviewing requires research, preparation, and practice, and Sakamanje can help you learn to present yourself in the best possible light. An advisor can show you common interview questions and strategies for answering those questions in the most effective way.  The best way to prepare is to do a  practice interview.  You can schedule a practice interview with an advisor, and can even have the interview recorded via webcam for later review.  The advisor can give you hints on how to improve your performance.</p></li>

      <p>I have an old box I stock things that may later be useful. I was at home a couple of weeks ago and opened it after a long time. The things I found in it were quite interesting.</p>
<p>Who remembers floppy disks?</p>

<p>My first laptop didn't have floppy drive. This was the external drive I got.</p>

<p>SE K750i. October 27, 2006. The phone was the shit then. Bought mine &#8358;32,000</p>

<p>Jan 8, 2008. SE W810, &#8358;27,900</p>
<p><img src="/assets/image/2013/02/w810i.jpg" /></p>
<p>March 23, 2008 (barely 3 months later), SE W880i, &#8358;30,000</p>

<p>Boxes.</p>

<p>Well, what would I say? Today's gold, tomorrow's copper.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, I used 6 Sony Ericsson phones straight up, starting from the blue faced T105. Should I count? T105, K750i, K770i, W810i, W880i, P910i. (I have used 5 Nokias after that and currently on my first LG).</p>
<p>Hahaha...I used to collect beautiful cards. It was my obsession. And don't deny you don't have something you collect too.</p>

<p>This one is funny. I didn't even have a girlfriend when I bought it.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/image/2013/02/card2.jpg" /></p>
<p>The other things were letters and cards from female friends (all of whom are married now), friends and fam.</p>
<p>And oh, yours truly before the beards :)</p>

      <p>The heat of the sun can only be compared to that of the movie 2012. It was as if the sun has been locked up for days, released and decided to unleash the bottled up heat that afternoon.<br />I wobbled down the road. Few meters away, I can see the little crowd already gathered there in front of the senate building. At that point I knew getting a bus isn't going to be an easy one. That second, I wished I had a car. Ok, maybe a bike. Or maybe just grow wings and fly away from there. My legs got heavier. I cursed silently, strongly hoping for the buses to show up.<br />Long minutes passed, sweat trickled down every part of me. But I was not alone. The look on everyone's face was as well scary. I try to calculate my chances. If two empty buses come around, maybe I will have a chance. But that afternoon, they were no where to be found. Maybe it's because exams were over. But for whatever reasons that may be, I was getting really impatient.<br />Private cars pass by. Most of them wound up and drove pass hurriedly trying not to catch the face of anyone in the crowd, probably not to be tempted to wait. Even the ones that didn't wound up simply ignore us. I cared less about them anyway. I know better to expect much from humans; not forgetting I'm one as well.<br />Then a beautiful, sleek, blue toyota camry pulled up. It was a couple of meters from me, but even it had pulled up directly in my front I wouldn't have bat an eyelid unless I was beckoned on. The guys close to it however thought otherwise. Or maybe it was the desperation. Three guys hurried towards it. And as if 'touch with care' was inscribed on the car, they gently tried to open the door. What followed was embaracing.<br />"Will you all fucking get out of my car!", the guy behind the wheels, who happens to be the only dude in the car, yelled at them.<br />And that moment I felt really bad. I couldn't help but feel a tinge of anger as well. No, not because he didn't pick up anybody. A lot of private cars have drove by and ignored us. But did he have to be that rude to refuse a hitch hike? "I'm sorry, I stopped to pick just a friend of mine", would have played the trick. Besides he is a young dude of our age range - one more reason he should be more understanding.<br />You know, if I were God, there are some people I will never make rich. Some people will never have that car (or in fact have the opportunity to borrow it). They will never be in that good position. Simply because they will never be useful to others. Well, I'm not God. And then, he is no man. And yes, I'm grateful for that. I'm only human too afterall. Maybe I would have been a culprit myself. But then, at times, it doesn't cost us too much to do that little help to touch the lives of others.</p>

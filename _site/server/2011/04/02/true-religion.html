      Olamide knocked on the gate. My wristwatch showed some minutes to 10pm. But in truth, the time should be past 9. I allow my watch some 15/20 minutes ahead as my way of trying to keep up to time and be early. <p /> I looked around. Beautiful neighbourhood. Silent hums of power plants and AC coarse the night. Lovely built houses, gardens and lights enveloped us. <p /> The house is a white bungalow. And from that front view, it looked big. Well atleaast I'm sure to count about 5 or more windows from that front already. That gave me a sigh of relief. There is surely room to accommodate us for the night. Somewhere inside, close to the gate is a cross sculpture. Not too big; golden. It has a white circle shape round it. If I remember well, that should be white in color. The outside area just before the road is covered with gravel stones. Then there are beautiful flowers in big vases planted just around the gutter edge. <p /> I picked up all this within some quick seconds. Then I picked up a stone and joined Olamide to knock the gate. I was sure people were inside. The generator was on. They weren't just hearing us. So I knocked harder. <p /> Few knocks after we had a little girl call out who is there. Olamide answered. She came close to the gate but didn't open. She peeped instead and asked who we were again. Olamide introduces us as corpers and ask if the 'circle leader' is around. She replied no. She then asked if she could talk to any older person around. The girl told us she will be back and left. <p /> Olamide sighed. She was looking very tired and stressed up. I bet I was too. The hustles of the day and 3 hours+ journey from camp has been a tough one. But I wasn't just tired. I was damn hungry and thirsty. In fact at that moment, I needed a lot of things. A good bath. A good dinner. A peaceful sleep. I winked at Olamide. That is saying all is well without the words. We waited patiently; I with one eye checking on the two big bags and pails we dropped just by the road. <p /> A man's voice came out from behind the gate. It was husky. But I couldn't pick even his face or any other thing about him. I allow Olamide step closer to do the talking. It is her church afterall. The man asked what we want in a rather harsh voice. Olamide greeted instead. I greeted him too. Olamide introduced us as corpers then more of herself along the lines of 'bearing the cross'. She emphasized she is a member of the church, which I guess bearing the cross means. She then explained our plight and that we need accommodation for the night. She added she had called the church in Lagos and was directed here. But she didn't finish. The man cut her short. <br />"We don't have accommodation here for you people", the man shouted. If he had said that gently, I would have taken it with lots of understanding. But he sounded more like 'you guys should just get the fuck away!'. <p /> Olamide mumbled some words; some explanations. But the man was halfway back before the words came out. She looked at me. I can see frustration and disappointment in those eyes. Frustration for all possible reasons; disappointment possibly because she was the one that compelled me to come along. <p /> I smiled at her. Poor girl. She must have been new to this. In my little life I have seen worst disappointments that belittle this as a joke. She expressed her surprise. 'Even in Akure, non-members come to spend a month at the church and they are well treated!' <br />I smiled again. Then reminded her it is not about the church but the personnel. 'We were just unlucky to meet the wrong person'. <p /> I pulled her hand. And together we walked into the darkness.

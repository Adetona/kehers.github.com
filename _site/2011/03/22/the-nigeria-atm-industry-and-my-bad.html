      I had to be in Lagos for an important meetup on Sunday. I have spent the last couple of days in a village in Cross River and Calabar was the closest flight pickup to Lag. I must say here I'm new around the state and had to ask my way to every destination. I had only one stop to the airport and ATM machine of the closest bank didn't work for my card. (Which makes me wonder why we are yet to and when we are going to have a unified/well interpolated switching system). This is an everyday disappointment feat, so I swallowed the pain and went ahead to the airport with the hopes there will be ATM there or atleast POS terminals for ticket payment. First blow, I was wrong! No working ATM and POS at the airport. <p /> My only option was to get back to town and look around for an ATM. After many failed tries, a lot of misdirections, snubs from girls who probably think I want to kidnap or ask them out, I managed to get to a street with a couple of banks. The first bank in sight on Mary Slessor street is Zenith bank and as should expect from a frustrated person, I rushed in. I started by checking my account balance. All seem right. As the machine noted I can only withdraw in multiples of N20,000, I punched in a request for N20,000. The machine carried me along. Time to pay out, it starred blankly at me for some seconds, told me transaction complete and gave out my card. <p /> I waited patiently, expecting the dude to pay out my money. Instead, he sang happily at me. Patience isn't much my strong part so I hissed angrily and left after a couple of minutes. <p /> I tried a couple of other banks. Some didn't work for GTB masterCard, the others simply can't dispense, have no network or off. <p /> Finally, I found a GTB bank at the upper right turning. You should see my sigh of relief. I hurried up to use the ATM. The machine seem working and ok. I slotted in the card and followed the process. Reply? 'Insufficient funds'! <p /> My heart raced. I checked my balance. Turns out I have been debited for the N20,000 I wasn't payed. Bad part, it's Sunday. No where to make any complaint. That will have to wait till Monday. Long story short, I was stranded and had to cancel my flight. I was only lucky there were other options. What if there were none? What if the ATM was my last resort to even going back? Well, my bad? I should never have relied heavily on ATM. And this is the morale of my story. <p /> But then it gets worse. When I got to complain in bank on Monday, I was told it will take up to 9 working days to revert the money. So if I had managed to pull the night with the hope of cashing out the next day, that'd have been ruined too?

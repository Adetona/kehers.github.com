      I remember that tinge of fear as I hauled my bags behind the bus, bade mum goodbye and faced the 9 hours journey ahead. I had always want to explore the world around me. Go to new places, see new faces. But even at that, I was still scared and nervous. Would I cope? This year, 2 of my besties have been posted to different far parts of the country. One to Zamfara, other to Anambra; places out of the South West comfort zone they've spent their lives knowing. And so is thousands of the new batch C corp members. <p /> It's normal to fear the unknown. It's ok to be worried about things we are living behind. The comfort, the love, the relationships, friends, belongings and all. But it's not always as bad as it seems. It could be fun and interesting. It is an opportunity to see the world around you in a different way. Meet new people, hear and possibly learn a new language, try new dishes, study a new culture, make new friends. <p /> The simple rule is just be open and embrace the new change coming your way. Plus, at the same time, dont, never actually, forget the world you leave behind. <p /> All the best to the new batch C corp members.

      I heard an interesting story yesterday. Two sheets, one with a Yes, the other with a No. No questions, just Yes and No and you choose one. <p /> I have thought it over and over again. You just have to choose between a yes and no. There is no question you are providing this for. Just a yes or no. Which would you choose? <p /> I use to think 'No' is the more difficult word. But then it is not. We, I for one, just find it hard in saying it. But once past that moment you drop it, that's all. It's like a full stop at the end of a paragraph. Chapter closes, story over. The only other effort you may need to add is sticking to the word. 'Yes' on the other hand is deeper. Yes is commitment. You may spend your whole life dealing with it. <p /> Yes is being responsible. Yes is being positive. Looking into a situation and believing in a good outcome. Yes is faith. It is the substance of something hoped for; an evidence of one unseen. <p /> While we should learn to say no, we should learn to say yes more. No to bad habbits and addictions. No to the oppression and corruption by our leaders. No to fuel subsidy! No! No! No! Yes to positive change. Yes to the believe we can affect our generation for good. Yes that we can stay strong no matter what comes our way. <p /> By the way, the dude in question chose yes and that was how he became the only corp member of a presidential committee on a national issue. <p /> Say yes. Be positive. (Except ofcourse the question is HIV:))
